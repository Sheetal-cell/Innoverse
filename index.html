      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Imagine a world where every brain is celebrated for its unique way of thinking, learning, and creating. That’s the essence of neurodiversity—a perspective that recognizes neurological differences like Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, and more as natural variations of the human mind, not deficits to be fixed.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>🧠 Different minds bring different strengths! Some excel at pattern recognition, others at problem-solving, creativity, or deep focus. Instead of trying to fit everyone into the same mold, neurodiversity encourages us to value and harness these differences—because innovation thrives when diverse minds collaborate.</p>
      <br>

      <p>At InnoVerse, we believe that true progress happens when we break barriers, embrace inclusivity, and create a world where neurodivergent individuals are not just accepted, but empowered. Whether in education, workplaces, or everyday life, neurodivergent perspectives spark new ideas, challenge the norm, and redefine what’s possible.</p>
      <br>

      <p>💡 Let’s build a future where every mind matters. Where thinking differently isn’t just okay—it’s the key to innovation. Welcome to a space where your mind is your superpower! 🚀</p>

      <h1>Awareness</h1>
      <p>
        Neurodiversity is a paradigm shift — a powerful reminder that there's no one "right" way to think, learn, or behave. At <strong>InnoVerse</strong>, we aim to raise awareness, break stereotypes, and foster inclusive environments where every mind can thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neurodiversity celebrates the unique ways our brains work. It includes individuals with autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, anxiety, and other cognitive differences — not as deficits, but as natural variations of the human mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        At <strong>InnoVerse</strong>, we believe in creating inclusive digital spaces that recognize and empower neurodivergent individuals. Awareness is the first step toward acceptance and support.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>🌈 <strong>What is Neurodiversity?</strong> — A concept that embraces brain differences as a form of diversity, just like gender or race.</li>
        <li>🎯 <strong>Why It Matters?</strong> — Understanding neurodiversity helps build workplaces, classrooms, and communities that are more supportive and less judgmental.</li>
        <li>📢 <strong>Common Myths Busted:</strong> Neurodivergent people are not “less” — they often bring extraordinary creativity, focus, or analytical skills.</li>
        <li>🤝 <strong>How You Can Help:</strong> Be kind. Be patient. Offer flexible solutions. Avoid assumptions and listen actively.</li>
        <li>📚 <strong>Resources:</strong> <a href="https://neurodiversityhub.org" target="_blank">Neurodiversity Hub</a>, <a href="https://neuroclastic.com" target="_blank">NeuroClastic</a>, <a href="https://www.autisticadvocacy.org" target="_blank">ASAN</a></li>
      </ul>
    
      <h2>🌟 Why Awareness Matters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Promotes Empathy:</strong> Understanding leads to compassion. It helps reduce bullying and isolation faced by neurodivergent individuals.</li>
        <li><strong>Encourages Inclusion:</strong> Awareness drives inclusive policies in education, workplaces, and healthcare.</li>
        <li><strong>Recognizes Strengths:</strong> Many neurodivergent individuals have exceptional abilities in memory, creativity, pattern recognition, and problem-solving.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h2>💬 Voices of Neurodiversity</h2>
      <p><em>"I’m not broken. I’m just wired differently. And that’s my superpower."</em></p>
      <p><em>"When I was accepted as I am, I finally felt like I belonged."</em></p>
    
      <h2>🔄 Common Misconceptions (and Truths!)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>❌ Myth:</strong> Neurodivergent people can't succeed in teams.<br><strong>✅ Truth:</strong> With the right support, they often bring unique perspectives and solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>❌ Myth:</strong> All neurodivergent people are the same.<br><strong>✅ Truth:</strong> Neurodiversity is a spectrum — no two minds are alike.</li>
        <li><strong>❌ Myth:</strong> Accommodations are "special treatment."<br><strong>✅ Truth:</strong> They're tools that level the playing field.</li>
